# Multi Signature Wallet
**A multi signature wallet is a wallet which acts just like an externally owned account, but with the (very important) feature that multiple owners and therefore multiple signatures, hence the name "multi signature", are required to pass a transaction. This is a decentralized way of having a wallet, because it needs multiple people to transact.**
